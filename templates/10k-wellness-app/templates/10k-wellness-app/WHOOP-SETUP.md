# WHOOP Polling Integration Setup

## 🎯 **Current Status: Polling Approach**

Your app is configured to use **polling** (checking for new data every 5 minutes) instead of webhooks. This is simpler to set up and works great for step tracking!

## 📋 **Setup Checklist**

### ✅ **Already Complete**
- [x] WHOOP integration hooks (`useWearables.ts`, `useWhoopIntegration.ts`)
- [x] OAuth flow implementation
- [x] Polling mechanism (auto-sync every 5 minutes)
- [x] Fallback to simulated data
- [x] UI components for connection status

### 🔄 **Next Steps**

#### **1. Get WHOOP Developer Access**

1. **Visit WHOOP Developer Portal**
   - Go to: https://developer.whoop.com
   - Sign up with your WHOOP account email
   - Complete developer verification (1-2 business days)

2. **Create OAuth Application**
   - Name: `10K Fitness Tracker`
   - Description: `Step tracking and wellness app`
   - Redirect URI: `http://localhost:5173/auth/whoop` (for development)
   - Scopes: `read:recovery read:cycles read:workout read:sleep read:profile`

3. **Get Your Credentials**
   - Copy Client ID and Client Secret from dashboard

#### **2. Configure Environment Variables**

Update your `.env` file:

```env
# Add these WHOOP credentials
VITE_WHOOP_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id_here
VITE_WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret_here
```

#### **3. Test the Connection**

1. Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the Wearables panel
3. Click "Connect" on WHOOP device
4. Complete OAuth flow in popup window
5. Your real WHOOP data will start syncing!

## 🔍 **How Polling Works**

```typescript
// Auto-sync every 5 minutes
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(async () => {
    try {
      await syncData(); // Fetches latest data from WHOOP API
      console.log('Auto-sync completed');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Auto-sync failed:', error);
    }
  }, 300000); // 5 minutes

  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [connections]);
```

## 📊 **Data You'll Get**

Once connected, your app will sync:

- **Recovery Score** (0-100%)
- **Resting Heart Rate** (BPM)
- **Heart Rate Variability** (HRV)
- **Sleep Data** (hours, quality)
- **Workout Data** (strain, calories, duration)
- **Estimated Steps** (calculated from distance)

## 🎮 **Current Demo Mode**

Right now, the app shows **simulated data** because no real API credentials are configured. This lets you:

- ✅ Test all UI components
- ✅ See how data flows through the app
- ✅ Experience the full user journey
- ✅ Demo to others without real device

## 🚀 **Production Deployment**

When ready for production:

1. **Update Redirect URI** in WHOOP app settings:
   - Development: `http://localhost:5173/auth/whoop`
   - Production: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/whoop`

2. **Set Production Environment Variables**:
   ```env
   VITE_WHOOP_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   VITE_WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ```

3. **Deploy** your app with the new environment variables

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **"Setup Required" Warning**
- This appears when `VITE_WHOOP_CLIENT_ID` is not set
- Add your real credentials to `.env` file
- Restart development server

### **OAuth Popup Blocked**
- Allow popups for your domain
- Try connecting in incognito mode
- Check browser console for errors

### **"Authentication Failed"**
- Verify Client ID and Secret are correct
- Check redirect URI matches exactly
- Ensure WHOOP account has developer access

### **No Data After Connection**
- WHOOP processes data periodically (not instant)
- Try manual sync button
- Check if you have recent workouts/sleep data

## 📱 **Mobile Considerations**

For mobile deployment:
- OAuth popups work better in mobile browsers
- Consider deep linking for native apps
- Test on actual mobile devices

## 🔄 **Fallback Strategy**

The app gracefully handles missing credentials:

1. **No credentials** → Shows simulated data
2. **Connection fails** → Falls back to simulated data
3. **API errors** → Uses last known data
4. **No internet** → Shows cached data

This ensures your app always works, even during development!

## 📈 **Next Features to Add**

Once basic WHOOP integration works:

- [ ] **Multiple device support** (Fitbit + WHOOP)
- [ ] **Historical data charts** (weekly/monthly trends)
- [ ] **Goal recommendations** based on recovery scores
- [ ] **Smart notifications** (rest day suggestions)
- [ ] **Social challenges** with recovery-based handicaps

## 🎯 **Ready to Connect?**

1. Get your WHOOP developer credentials
2. Add them to `.env` file
3. Restart the app
4. Click "Connect" on WHOOP device
5. Enjoy real data! 🚀
