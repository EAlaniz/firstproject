# XMTP V3 Components - Official Browser SDK Mirror

This directory contains components that mirror the official XMTP V3 Browser SDK structure and patterns.

## Current Structure

### Official XMTP V3 Components

- **`SimpleXMTPMessaging.tsx`** - Main messaging interface using official XMTP V3 browser-sdk patterns

### Supporting Components

- **`Modal.tsx`** - Generic modal component for wallet connection
- **`StepTracker.tsx`** - Main step tracking dashboard component with retro styling
- **`EnhancedWalletConnector.tsx`** - Wallet connection interface

### Organized XMTP Implementation

The main XMTP implementation has been reorganized into `/src/xmtp/` to mirror the official XMTP V3 Browser SDK:

```
src/xmtp/
├── index.ts                    # Main exports (mirrors official SDK)
├── Client.ts                   # Enhanced client with all official methods  
├── Conversations.ts            # Complete conversations API
├── content-types/              # Full content type system
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── text.ts
│   ├── reaction.ts
│   ├── reply.ts
│   ├── readReceipt.ts
│   ├── attachment.ts
│   └── remoteAttachment.ts
└── errors/                     # Comprehensive error handling
    └── index.ts
```

## Architecture Benefits

### Official XMTP V3 Compliance
- **Mirrors Official SDK**: Structure matches XMTP V3 Browser SDK exactly
- **Official Patterns Only**: Uses only documented XMTP V3 patterns and methods
- **Latest SDK Version**: Built for XMTP Browser SDK v3.0.3+
- **Full Feature Parity**: Includes all official content types and error handling

### Production Ready
- **Enhanced Error Recovery**: 25+ specific error types with automatic recovery
- **Database Cleanup**: Automated corruption detection and cleanup
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and resource management
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compliance with official SDK types

## Usage

```tsx
import { SimpleXMTPMessaging } from './components/SimpleXMTPMessaging';
import { SimpleXMTPProvider } from './contexts/SimpleXMTPContext';

// Wrap your app with the provider
<SimpleXMTPProvider>
  <SimpleXMTPMessaging />
</SimpleXMTPProvider>
```

The implementation automatically:
1. Initializes XMTP client using official static factory methods
2. Handles installation management and database cleanup
3. Provides comprehensive error recovery and retry logic
4. Supports all official content types (Text, Reactions, Replies, etc.)
5. Includes consent management and group permissions

## Migration from Legacy Components

All legacy XMTP components have been removed in favor of the new official pattern implementation:

- ❌ `XMTPMessaging.tsx` (legacy pattern)
- ❌ `DMChat.tsx` (legacy pattern) 
- ❌ `ConversationsList.tsx` (legacy pattern)
- ❌ `MessageThread.tsx` (legacy pattern)
- ❌ `NewConversationModal.tsx` (legacy pattern)
- ✅ `SimpleXMTPMessaging.tsx` (official V3 patterns)

The new implementation provides all the same functionality but uses only official XMTP V3 browser-sdk patterns and methods.
